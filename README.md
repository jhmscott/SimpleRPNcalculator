# SimpleRPNcalculator

When I satarted 2nd year electrical engineering, I was required to buy a new graphing calculator. 
It was the first I had ever owned to support RPN(Reverse Polish Notation). I fell in love with it right away.
After learning about stacks in data structures and algorithms, I immediatly thought "I can do that."


This projects relies on the following libraries:
1. The Arduino Keypad library v3.1.1 - by Mark Stanley and Alexander Brevig - found here: https://github.com/Chris--A/Keypad
2. The Adafruit GFX library v1.4.8 - by Limor Fried - found here: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library
3. the Adafruit PCD8544 Library v1.0.0 - by Limor Fried - found here: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PCD8544-Nokia-5110-LCD-library

Additionally I used the builitn Arduion SPI and EEPROM libraries
