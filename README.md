# SimpleRPNcalculator

When I satarted 2nd year electrical engineering, I was required to buy a new graphing calculator. 
It was the first I had ever owned to support RPN(Reverse Polish Notation). I fell in love with it right away.
After learning about stacks in data structures and algorithms, I immediatly thought "I can do that."
